<p>Dear Pandemic Response Committee</p>
<p>I am so worried about this pandemic, it seems like there is lots of PPE and testing kits this time around (which is great, I am not so old that I don’t remember all the scandals surrounding PPE back when the COVID19 pandemic first was!) But it seems like there should be something more we can do, are we doomed to go through a cycle of pandemic after pandemic, always sitting at home and worrying about whether we will die?</p>
<p>Some of the folks last time said that I was overcautious, and that it was just a made-up pandemic that we were all afraid of, but I’ve got an old nan who’s quite frail, I can’t go taking risks when it comes to her health, I would be just devastated if anything happened to her.</p>

<p>Dear Pandemic Response Committee,</p>
<p>I am so frightened about new pandemic, the news you read about it is very scary. Thank you so much for all your hard work you are doing to protect us.</p>
<p>I am writing out of concern for the state of the health care system in Ardkeld, it is becoming very clear that the NHS is overwhelmed. We hear about it in the news every year, it’s like flu season comes as a surprise somehow and then of course there’s a new pandemic on top of that. I was so worried during the COVID19 pandemic when all the nightingale hospitals were built and the poor doctors and nurses and all were being so overworked. I hope that there will be enough funds to increase the hospital staff the way that the government really ought to do.</p>
<p>My son is a nurse at the Riverview and he has just been worked off his feet these last two weeks, quite frankly it is bringing back our PTSD from the COVID times and our mental health is struggling. But I am sure it is just that it takes time to build things like the nightingale hospitals and get the money from Parliament to hire some more staff.</p>
<p>I am so glad that you are getting in medical supplies and preparing stockpiles as it will be a huge help. I only hope that it will be enough.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all the hard work you do,<br> Sebastian Malmsbury</p>

<p>Dear Pandemic Response Committee,</p>
<p>It is an outrage the way that in this modern era, pandemics are being manufactured and allowed to disrupt our very way of life. Last time it was the so-called “COVID” virus and the sheer utter gall of the government trying to shut down everything that gave us pleasure in life, whether that’s a simple birthday party with friends or the ability to go out to the shops without having to wear a suffocating mask.</p>
<p>Now it is supposed to be some sort of anthrax “pandemic”, just as though we are gullible enough to believe that - what rot! The last time I heard something so ridiculous, there were terrorists mailing unidentified white powders to US senators! Moreover, you think that this “CRISPR” technology is going to be safe and effective - yet another experiment that you are inflicting on an unsuspecting populace, just like those so-called “COVID vaccines”.</p>
<p>You can be assured that I will <em>not</em> be voting for any of you when the next election comes!</p>
<p>All the best,<br> Jade Gilbert</p>

<p>Dear Pandemic Response Committee,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and hard work trying to protect our beautiful city from this terrible pandemic. You hear so much nowadays about disease outbreaks in oh, just every city, and it is a real relief to hear that you are doing the hard work needed in order to keep us all safe.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t want to take your time up, only I have a medical condition and can’t wear these FFP2 masks that you are mandating. It seems real hard to be expected to stay in my house all the day long, and a real infringement on everyone’s liberties because surely it is unfair to make us all wear masks.</p>
<p>Respectfully,<br> Destiny Weckmann</p>

<p>The situation appears to be quite grim in Ardkeld, as we see cases mount and the city struggles under the wave of another pandemic, coming hard on the heels of the COVID pandemic which began nearly five years ago.</p>
<p>To date there have been 39 deaths attributed to the pathogen, <em>Bacillus anthracis</em>, and hundreds of people are currently ill with the disease.</p>
<p>The city’s Emergency Pandemic Response Committee is working to pin down the source of the outbreak, but there are real fears for what impact this new pandemic will have on the city’s economy. The spectre of COVID looms large over the residents of this lovely city.</p>
<p>The EPRC have proposed the use of a novel CRISPR/Cas12a and Metagenomic Sequencing method for rapid diagnosis, but this technique does not yet have NHS approval and there are concerns over the potential false positive and false negative rates of this new technique.</p>
<p>The Emergency Pandemic Response Committee was not available for comment. The First Minister of Scotland made a statement saying that every effort possible is being made to tackle the pandemic in Ardkeld.</p>

<p>Ben Clark liked dinosaurs and trucks. Friends and family say that he was always a treasure.</p>
<p>Ben is survived by his parents and grandparents, and by his siblings Charlie, Alfie, and Jacob.</p>

<p>Citizens of Ardkeld should be glad that the city’s Emergency Pandemic Response Committee, quickly convened when a new pandemic began to hit Ardkeld, has been so effective. While the initial death toll from the pandemic appeared to be quite heavy, the actions taken by the EPRC seem to have been sensible and will hopefully be effective.</p>
<p>Officials from the NHS have publicly praised the Ardkeld EPRC, saying that it is difficult to imagine a more effective public health response</p>
<p>There do continue to be deaths occuring due to the pandemic, but hopefully Ardkeld will see the death toll begin to decrease in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Governments across the globe have seen how successful power-grabs in the name of public health can be, following on the wave of restrictions imposed because of so-called viral diseases like COVID-19 and “mpox”. So-called scientists are fearmongering - aerosols, monkeys, “bird” flu - now they think that they can fool us into thinking that the air and water are unsafe. Citizens of Ardkeld should stand strong against this terrible tyranny! No more mask mandates, no more senseless restrictions!</p>
<p>Our elders should not be left to die alone, left frightened and hopeless in a mandatory lockdown claimed to be “for their benefit.” Our children should not be left to struggle through “pandemic” after “pandemic” - their language and literacy skills have been left behind due to these lockdowns, and their mental health is suffering. It is time that we take back control of our lives and end this tyranny of fear-mongering and so-called science. Citizens of Ardkeld, stand with me and resist this most recent attack on your freedoms and your lives.</p>

<p><font size="+3"><b>BBC Scotland </b></font><br> <font size="+2"><b>anthrax pandemic in Ardkeld</b></font><br> by Edith Rogers<br> 09 March, 2025</p>
<p>Hard on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic and a number of other health scares (monkeypox, or “mpox”, avian flu, and worries about other infectious disease outbreaks), another pandemic has hit the Scottish town of Ardkeld. This time, it’s <em>Ardkeld</em>, a bacterium that can very sadly be fatal.</p>
<p>There have been 39 deaths in the pandemic so far, but perhaps the most frightening aspect to this new pandemic is rumours that these <em>Bacillus anthracis</em> strains may have become resistant to even more antibiotics - a truly chilling possibility.</p>
<p>Scientists have been warning about the antibiotic resistance crisis for years, saying that careless use of antibiotics could mean that these precious medicines will no longer be available to us in the future.</p>
<p>Some of the <em>Bacillus anthracis</em> strains found in Ardkeld are reportedly resistant to all clinically available antibiotics, and scientists warn that these drug-resistant pathogens might be able to spread to new locations. Will nearby towns be next, or could these <em>Bacillus anthracis</em> strains go as global as the SARS-COV2 virus did?</p>
