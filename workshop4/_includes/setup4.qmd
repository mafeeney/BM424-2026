```{r GlobalSetup4, include=FALSE}
# Define global variables that will be used across the book
# These need to be edited each year: workshop3_date

#Probably do not need to run the following 
#currently setup4 is being run after setup3, which already sets the seed for each group - but these can be commented out if needed, later on
#Set a seed for each group page
#year <- as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), "%Y"))
#set.seed(groupseed + year)



# Define the number of deaths, cases, and ICU cases for the outbreak for workshop 4
# old code was: 
#outbreak_deaths <- sample(10:30, 1)
#outbreak_cases <- sample(400:700, 1)
#outbreak_icu <- sample(10:30, 1)
