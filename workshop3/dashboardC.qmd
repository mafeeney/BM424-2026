## Key Performance Indicators {.unnumbered}

### A&E Statistics {.unnumbered}

::: card
Statement from `r hosp_name`: As part of the `r hosp_name`'s ongoing commitment to excellence, the hospital diligently monitors key performance indicators and strives to meet established targets. While progress has been made, we acknowledge that certain goals remain unmet. We are actively working to address these challenges and enhance patient care.

*Key Performance Targets:*

-   Waiting time for an ambulance (category 2 event) should be no more than 18 minutes

-   95% or more of all patients waiting in A&E should be seen in less than 4 hours

-   85% of all patients waiting for cancer treatment should be seen within 62 days

## Infection Control Metrics {.unnumbered}

::: card
The `r hosp_name` hospital strives to meet stringent targets for infection control and antibiotic stewardship to ensure patient safety and combat antimicrobial resistance. Infection control protocols are critical in maintaining high standards of hygiene and patient care. Similarly, antibiotic stewardship programs are essential for optimizing the use of antimicrobials, thereby reducing the risk of resistance and ensuring effective treatments for future generations.

## Community Health Data {.unnumbered}

::: card
The `r hosp_name` monitors the prevalence of COVID-19 and other viruses in the community to ensure they are prepared for potential surges in patient admissions, enabling them to allocate resources and staff efficiently. By tracking these trends, the hospital can implement timely public health interventions and provide accurate information to the community to mitigate the spread of infections. Additionally, continuous monitoring helps in identifying emerging outbreaks early, allowing for a rapid response that minimizes the impact on public health and healthcare services.

-   `r Covid_result`

-   We are seeing an increase in infections caused by other respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, RSV).
