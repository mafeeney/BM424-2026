### Epidemiological Data {.unnumbered}

A team of scientists working together have in a PHS lab have isolated and cultured <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> (following standard procedures) from a number of patient samples taken during this outbreak; isolated <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> DNA from these cultures; sequenced this DNA using an Illumina MiSeq platform; assembled the short paired-end reads; and compared these assemblies to the extant <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> genome sequences available in the NCBI databases. The results of these experiments are summarised in the table below.
