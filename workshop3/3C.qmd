### Epidemiological Data {.unnumbered}

A team of scientists working together have in a PHS lab have isolated and cultured MRSA from a number of patient samples taken during this outbreak; isolated genomic DNA from cultures of these isolates; sequenced this DNA using an Illumina MiSeq platform; assembled the short paired-end reads; and compared these assemblies to the extant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> sequences available in the NCBI databases. The results of these experiments are summarised in the table below.
