### Epidemiological Data {.unnumbered}

A team of scientists working together have in a PHS lab have isolated and cultured influenza virus (using a standard tissue culture model) from a number of patient samples taken during this outbreak; isolated influenza RNA from these cultures; reverse-transcribed this to DNA, and sequenced this DNA using an Illumina MiSeq platform; assembled the short paired-end reads; and compared these assemblies to the extant influenza sequences available in the NCBI databases. The results of these experiments are summarised in the table below.
